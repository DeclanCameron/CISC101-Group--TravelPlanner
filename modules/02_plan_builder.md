### **Module 2 - Plan Builder (Options → Days)**
#### Purpose
Convert the Options list into balanced draft day plans.
 This module focuses on selecting activities in a clear sequence (Morning → Midday → Afternoon → Evening) using proximity logic and simple theme variation, while leaving all feasibility checks to Module 3.
#### Activity Schema
Each activity in the Options list includes:
type
estimated duration
cost range
distance or travel time
theme tags (used for variation)
#### Proximity Guidelines
These proximity rules guide selection but do not perform feasibility checks (handled in Module 3).

Morning activity (near lodging):
 • generally within short walking distance or around 15 minutes of travel from lodging.
 
Midday activity (close by):
 • near the morning activity, ideally within the same area or around 10 minutes travel.
 
Afternoon activity (broader range):
 • can be further away (up to roughly 20–30 minutes travel) to allow variety and a change of setting.
 
Evening activity (restaurant or event):
 • preferably within reasonable travel distance from the afternoon activity or lodging to simplify the end of the day.
#### Theme Variation
To create a balanced day, avoid selecting the same activity type for more than one daytime block.
 The afternoon activity should preferably introduce a different theme than the morning and midday selections.
#### Loop
For each day:
Morning: pick an activity near lodging.

 Midday: pick an activity close to the morning selection, with a different type.
 
 Afternoon: pick an activity that offers a different theme or experience.
 
 Evening: pick a restaurant or optional event within reasonable distance.
#### Output Format
For each day, list:
 activity name
 type
 duration
 cost range
 distance or travel time
 brief rationale (e.g., proximity and theme balance)
 
A short daily summary can be added to show how proximity and variation were achieved.
